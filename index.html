      I’m MDL. I invest in the people building tomorrow and help them move faster.
      I’ve been a founder, an investor across stages, and a community builder who connects
      high-trust networks around the world. My work blends prepared-mind rigor with the belief
      that progress accelerates when great people find each other.
