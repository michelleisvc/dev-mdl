        <summary>Signal in the Noise: Early Thoughts on AI Agents</summary>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 01, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Spent the morning synthesizing how agent-native workflows reshape expectations around
          trust and autonomy. Noting early patterns that feel similar to the shift from on-prem to cloud:
          once people feel the convenience, the baseline expectations change permanently.

        <summary>Patterns from Founder Conversations</summary>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 30, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Had a few calls with technical founders building infra for multimodal models. The biggest
          consistent pain point: identity and permissioning for agents operating across tools. Everyone
          feels the gap, no one believes the existing stack solves it.

          Rough draft of a framework to track demand signals across B2B use cases. Early adopters
          are clustering in finance, e-commerce ops, and customer support—segments where speed-to-action
          matters more than perfect accuracy.

        <summary>Reflections on Trust & Safety Themes</summary>

        <p>
          Realized many historical trust frameworks assume static systems and human gatekeepers.
          Agents break both assumptions. Thinking through how those mental models need to evolve if
          autonomy becomes the default.
