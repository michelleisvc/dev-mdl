  <h1>How Learning to Code as a VC to Shipping My First Site as an Investor</h1>

  <p>I became “code curious” when I started building more advanced Excel models. Something about nested formulas and circular references flipped a switch in my brain. It planted the seed that maybe, just maybe, I could learn to code. That seed sprouted when I was working on an investment thesis on AI coding tools at my previous firm, which later led to an investment in Lovable, an AI coding platform for non technical people. It checked all the boxes investors quietly adore, an inflection point, a real market tailwind, and expanded access.</p>

  <p>Naturally, I started playing with Lovable, and that was the beginning of my learning to code rabbit hole. My first project was building a website using ChatGPT. To guide myself, I picked up a book from my local library by Paul McFedries. I have built websites before using no code tools like Wix, great templates, but I always felt boxed in by their limitations. I wanted to build something from scratch, or scratch ish. Paul’s guide helped, but there is still a real knowledge barrier when you are staring at an empty code editor.</p>

  <p>The thing about me, once I focus on something, I get obsessed. So alongside the book, I applied to a free coding bootcamp through Bay Valley Tech. Their prerequisite was Khan Academy’s “Computer Programming, JavaScript and the Web.” My website is built with HTML and CSS, but the course gave me a foundation for understanding how to read, audit, and edit code without spiraling.</p>

  <p>I gave myself the week of Thanksgiving to go from zero to one, read the book, build the website, and deploy it. It took me about one and a half weeks, not one, so consider this my gentle PSA, give yourself more time.</p>

  <p>My first real challenge was setting up my developer environment. My starter pack included, GitHub, Git, VS Code, Cloudflare Pages, and ChatGPT premium. With that, I was off to the races. My first prompt was a pun generator, ridiculous, delightful, and it made me feel like queen of the mountain.</p>

  <p>My workflow became, ChatGPT → VS Code → GitHub → Cloudflare Pages. But when I reached Cloudflare, my website would not load. I tried for longer than my pride prefers to admit.</p>

  <p>I had been invited to a Hacks giving coding night hosted by Glo Maldonado. The event supported Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts and Double Union. The vibe was warm and welcoming, which has not always been my experience in technical spaces. My theory is that real experts are translators who can explain complex ideas simply and understand why now is the moment for change.</p>

  <p>The group used my reading list idea as the guinea pig project, and three teams organically formed. One team built a library interface. Another created “ChatVC,” a ChatGPT for MDL. The third built “Michelle’s Mind,” merging all ideas and adding a deck upload feature. Watching three approaches to the same idea reminded me of my mother’s line, “Every mind is its own world.”</p>

  <p>Still, my website would not deploy. My friend Devin Guillory, a computer science PhD student at UC Berkeley, helped me debug the issue, which turned out to be a syncing problem between GitHub and VS Code. We created a new properly synced repository and the site finally went live.</p>

  <p>I chose a simple dev forward aesthetic with “hello world” as my greeting. My hope was to build a home for my thoughts, my blog posts, and my reading list. It is simple and imperfect. As a mother of this little digital baby, I can say, it may not be the cutest, but it is mine.</p>

  <p>This project pulled me even further into the world of coding. Next, I want to explore automating my investor workflow. I am curious what other investors are automating and which tools they use.</p>
